# Hate Speech Detection Model

This project aims to detect hate speech in social media posts or user-generated content using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 📁 Files
- `hate-speech-detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `train_data.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset.

## 🧠 Model Details
The model uses a pipeline of:
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Machine Learning classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)

## ⚙️ Setup & Requirements
Before running the notebook, install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone this repo or download the files.

Open the `hate-speech-detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

Run all cells sequentially.

## 📊 Output
The notebook prints evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and may include visualizations (e.g., bar charts of hate speech classes).

## 📌 Note
This project is for academic purposes. Dataset content may be offensive as it is used for training detection algorithms.
